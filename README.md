# Wingify

Hello,
Your challenge was really exciting, personally I kept the project without using any external libraries, just pure vanilla JS
Cause I firmly believe that most of the jquery things can be achieved using pure JS,
I am also well versed with SASS, but I felt for a project so small SASS wouldn't be necessary.

For the email fields, I used native required methods, however I could make a custom popup too but I really wanted to provide a bare-bones structure ready!

My cookie knowldege is very minimal, So I used whatever logic I could find and made it functional,
If I could work with someone who could guide me a little cause I really want to love to learn. I'm a self learner but a little guidance would go a long way!

Thank you for your challenge,
It was really interesting.
